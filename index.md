**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
We discussed the difference between BERT and TF-IDF for transaction memos. It turns out that while BERT is a relatively "fancier" process, because of the strucutre of transaction memos, TF-IDF performs better and takes much less time to run. 

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
Feature engineering will be a large focus in our quarter 2 project. Based on the information we have and the features we can create, we can attempt to determine which work best for any given transaction category and whether they bias risk scores in any particular direction. Then, accuracy relatively the same, different features can be used to be more or less conservative with risk. 

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
Categorizing transactions from memos tends to be fairly straightforward, so I think the most improvement can probably be done in engineering features from the rest of the data, ie how amount spent/used changes accross categories and the like. 

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
I think introducing a time series model like a moving average might be good way to predict transaction values for users that can then be used in risk scoring.
